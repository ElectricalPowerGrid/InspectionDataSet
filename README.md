# Inspection of Electrical Power Distribution Grid

We present photographs of inspections of the electrical power network (13.8 kV) carried out in southern Brazil. The inspections were performed close to the city of Blumenau by researchers from the high voltage laboratory, Regional University of Blumenau (FURB). 

240 photographs of the electrical power network are presented:  
120 are damaged structures and/or components.  
120 are in normal conditions.    
 
Among the problems found in the distribution network, the following stand out:
* Contaminated insulators.
* Broken insulators.
* Contaminated crosshead.
* Birds' nests on the crosshead.
* Fungi strongly attached to the structure. 

OBS: For benchmark comparisons, the structure of the dataset for **YOLOv5** or **YOLOv7** is (valid/images, valid/labels, train/images, train/labels).
The structure of the dataset for **YOLOv6** is (images/train, images/val, labels/train, labels/val).

To compare the results with our research you can follow the split of the data of the (train.txt and val.txt) files. You can call these files only using YOLOv5 as the latest models require the split to be manually performed.

This dataset was built and organized by Dr. Stefano Frizzo Stefenon and Dr. Luiz Henrique Meyer.
The annotations were performed by Guilherme Veiga Santos Pinto under the supervision of Dr. Laio Oriel Seman.
